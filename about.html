        <p class="text-m xl:text-lg">
            £100bn per year, that's the figure that a <a class="underline"
                href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-31/brexit-is-costing-the-uk-100-billion-a-year-in-lost-output">recent
                study by Bloomberg</a> calculated is the cost of the
            lost growth caused by Brexit; The equivalent of two 2008 recessions hitting the UK at the same time.
            <br /><br />
            This website, costofbrexit.com, was set up in response to provide an easy-to-understand example of how we
            could have invested this figure into the UK. Even so, the economy in reality is more complex and often
            experiences downturns less linearly than this website is simulating and is more than likely worse than the
            scenario we are showing here.
            <br /><br />
            This is because when the economy starts shrinking; people start cutting back which only causes it to shrink
            even faster. It's for this reason that when more data comes in from the real world we will update this
            counter and you can always see our sources <a class="underline" href="sources.html">here</a>.
            <br /><br />
            So what's behind this lost growth? Put simply, Red tape and not the kind you use to wrap a birthday present.
            It's this that is affecting every aspect of British Life from Businesses unable to hire workers to the
            increasing cost of living partially caused by the drop in the value of the pound.
            <br /><br />
            But we by no means have to accept this cost. There are in-fact things that we could reverse to reduce the
            cost of Brexit even whilst being outside of the European Union, for example:
            <br /><br />
        </p>
        <ul class="text-m xl:text-lg list-disc list-inside">
            <li>The UK opted out of the Pet Passport scheme - British Pets now have to pay £250 for a health certificate
                each time they wish to go on holiday.</li>
            <li>The UK opted out of the SPS scheme for Great Britain - This now means additional checks have to be
                performed on goods entering from Great Britain to the EU at considerable cost even though we still
                follow the same standards.</li>
            <li>The UK failed to authorize the ability of insect-based food start-ups to continue selling their products
                - This was originally authorized by the EU food agency and lapsed when the UK exited.</li>
            <li>The UK failed to preserve the ban on mobile roaming fees - All but one mobile operator has reinstated
                the roaming fees post-brexit.</li>
        </ul>
